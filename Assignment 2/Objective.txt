Learning Objectives :

 - Understand real-world image noise sources.
 - Implement noise models in Python.
 - Apply spatial filtering for image restoration.
 - Evaluate restoration quality using objective metrics.

Assignment Tasks : 

Task 1: Image Selection and Preprocessing
- Load a surveillance-style image (street, corridor, parking area)
- Convert the image to grayscale
- Display the original image

Task 2: Noise Modeling
- Simulate:
- Gaussian noise (sensor noise)
- Salt-and-pepper noise (transmission errors)
- Display noisy images

Task 3: Image Restoration Techniques
- Apply spatial filters:
- Mean filter
- Median filter
- Gaussian filter
- Observe noise suppression and detail preservation

Task 4: Performance Evaluation
- Compute:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- Compare restored images with original

Task 5: Analytical Discussion
- Print filter-wise performance comparison
- Identify the best restoration method for each noise type
- Justify results based on theory

Learning Objectives

 - Understand image sensing and acquisition mechanisms.
 - Apply grayscale conversion and preprocessing.
 - Analyze effects of sampling (resolution reduction).
 - Analyze effects of quantization (bit-depth reduction).
 - Visually and analytically compare image quality.

Assignment Tasks :

Task 1: Project Setup and Introduction
- Create a project folder document_scanner/
- Create a Python file scanner.py
- Add header comments (Name, Roll No, Course, Unit, Assignment Title)
- Print a welcome message describing the document scanning system

Task 2: Image Acquisition
- Load a document image (PDF scan / printed text image) OR capture using webcam
- Resize the image to a standard size (e.g., 512×512)
- Convert the image to grayscale
- Display original and grayscale images

Task 3: Image Sampling (Resolution Analysis)
- Down-sample the grayscale image to simulate:
- High resolution (512×512)
- Medium resolution (256×256)
- Low resolution (128×128)
- Upscale back for visualization
- Compare text clarity and edge sharpness

Task 4: Image Quantization (Gray Level Reduction)
- Quantize grayscale image into:
- 256 gray levels (8-bit)
- 16 gray levels (4-bit)
- 4 gray levels (2-bit)
- Visualize quantization artifacts

Task 5: Quality Observation & Analysis
- Print observations on:
- Loss of fine text details
- Readability degradation
- Suitability for OCR
- Display all outputs in a single comparison figure
